      We are a small company of vampires and humans that are and have been creating beings
      to make super soldier vampires. We have decided to let one such being
      stream. <br /><br />To that end we have made Subject Omega, also known as Drako Vishious,
      a png tuber who hopes to one day be a vtuber. You can find more
      information about him on his About Drako Vishious page.
